## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
**OpenCraft** is programmed on Java, requires only a library and it isn't programmed on OpenGL. OpenGL is some hard to learn, so we had to use [The Java Canvas Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Canvas.html). 

Any library used here is open-source. This project is open-source and Free for everyone. If you want, you can donate or fork this repository.
